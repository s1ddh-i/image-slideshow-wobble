      <p>Dear Friend,</p>
      <p>
        I just wanna make you the happiest you've ever been.
        I want to make you feel safe and loved and comforted.
        I want you to know that you can come to me when you're not ok, 
        when your eyes are filled with tears and I'll hold you till you're a little more ok.
        I'm always here for you. I love you at your best and at your worst.
Nothings gonna change that. Ours is one of those love stories ppl will talk abt for years to come bc we have something extraordinary, something real. 
        You are not just my world, you're my everything.
        I'm here and I'm gonna keep being here every day for the rest of our lives. 
        I'm not leaving, I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying right here with you. 
        I wouldn't dream of being anywhere else
        You truly are my home, my safe place, the love of my life.
        I want you to know that I sure as hell mean it when I say I'd do anything for you.
        I'd do absolutely anything. 
        I love you now and I love you always.
        Everything is going to be okay. 
        We are going to be okay.
        This will last as long as we choose each other and keep choosing each other for the rest our lives.
        And I have no doubt in my mind that we will. 
        I love you. Really I do. With everything I have in me.
        I love you. I hope you have the happiest birthday ever.
        
        
      </p>
      <p><strong>HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY!!!!!</strong></p>
